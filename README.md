LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), binary classification model will be developed to predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan?

This is how the loan process works. When the applicants apply for a loan from the LendingClub company, the company has to make a decision for the loan based on the applicants' data provided. But, there are two type of risks with decision the company make:

+ Not approving the loan in case the applicant is likely to repay the loan, this decision could result in a loss of business to the company
+ To approve the loan in case the applicant is less likely to repay the loan, this could result in a financial loss for the company

This case study will provide us an opportunity to deal with the real business problems. 

For the scope of this project, a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club will be used.
